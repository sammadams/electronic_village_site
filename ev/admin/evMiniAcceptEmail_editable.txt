Being placed on the wait list is quite an accomplishment as this year we had as many as 55 submissions for only 12 presentations in this event. We usually have at least one cancellation, so it is likely that your presentation could be added to the program. To be prepared, we request that you read the following information carefully.  
 
Audiovisual Equipment
------------------------
The Electronic Village will provide an LCD projector and screen for your brief presentation/demonstration and 5 computers equipped with microphones and speakers for the hands-on work by 10-15 participants (2-3 at each computer). We encourage you to bring your own laptop for your presentation; otherwise, only 4 computers will be available to your participants. There will also be space for participants who bring their own laptops.  
 
What Happens Next? 
------------------------
Please inform all of your co-presenters (if any) that this presentation has been placed on the wait list. When a space becomes available on the program, you will be contacted with the available date and time. You must then communicate with your co-presenters (if any) to ensure they can participate.
