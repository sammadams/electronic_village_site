This is our first year of inviting and vetting Hot Topics proposals. We have received an excess of promising proposals, and are provisionally accepting a number of these high-quality proposals as possible substitutes for non-accepting or absent presenters. We are pleased to inform you that your proposal has been provisionally accepted on this basis, and will, if you accept, be presented in the event of a cancellation or non-appearance of a scheduled presenter. 

Please indicate your acceptance of this invitation to present by replying directly to this email before January 10, 2017.

Please be aware that if asked to present in the Hot Topics sessions, your presentation will be webcast at http://callis2017.pbworks.com. After the convention, the recording will be globally and freely available at the same link. Abe Reshad, CALL-IS Webcast Development Team Coordinator, will be in contact with you in the new year.

Again, thank you for your willingness to present and share in this exciting professional venue. We look forward to hearing from you soon, and to seeing you in Seattle in 2017.

Best regards,
Jack Watson, CALL-IS Chair
