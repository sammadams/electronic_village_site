CERTIFICATES
---------------

In an effort to reduce waste and conserve resources, the Electronic Village will ONLY be issuing digital certificates this year. If you MUST have a paper certificate, please contact ev@call-is.org with the details of your presentation and we will prepare a paper certificate for you to pick up at the convention. We will not send paper certificates by mail. If you have any questions, please contact our program manager at ev@call-is.org.
