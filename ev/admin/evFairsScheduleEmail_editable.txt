Please check the date and time of your presentation, then contact ev-fair@call-is.org if there are any problems. It is very important that you check all the details of your presentation.

Have in mind that titles may be edited to fewer than 50 characters. If you want to redefine the title of you presentation or correct any detail, also send the changes to ev-fair@call-is.org.

Please communicate to us any updates to the equipment needs listed in your initial proposal and verify any co-presenters' names and email addresses.  Since you are the contact or primary person listed, it is your responsibility to inform co-presenters of the status of this presentation.

Please show up 10 minutes in advance of your presentation to set up.  Remember that you will give your presentation twice during your assigned Technology Fair; you will have 20 - 25 minutes to complete it each time.  Prompt completion of your presentation will be appreciated by both the next presenter and the EV staff.

If you are scheduled at "PC" or a "Mac" station, you have one computer with two monitors for your use during your presentation. You may connect your own device to the second monitor if you wish.

If you are scheduled at a "BYOD" station, you will need to bring your own computer or device and will set up at the circular tables.

Please remember there will be presenters on either side of your station, so we would ask that you control your volume as a courtesy to the other presenters.

We recommend that you bring at least 30 handouts for your audience with information from your presentation or have a link that participants can copy to find further information online.
