Presenters are expected to remain for the entire event (about 2 hours). Confirmation that you will be present at the TESOL Convention to deliver your presentation is required. 

Please understand that this is an invitation to present only and involves no financial commitment from TESOL or the CALL Interest Section. You will be responsible for payment of all convention-related expenses, including registration fees, travel, and housing.

Technology Showcase sessions are typically webcast live.  Please visit www.callis2018.pbworks.com for instructions to access the live webcasts and post-session archived recordings. For friends and colleagues who cannot attend in person, please encourage them to tune in live.  More information regarding the webcasting of your session will be provided in March 2018. Presenters should have their slides and presentations materials ready at least 2 weeks prior to the convention so they can be sent to the webcast team to prepare for the live webcasts.
