Many of the proposals were highly rated, but unfortunately were on topics similar to other submissions that were rated slightly higher. In particular, there were many proposals for applications such as polling apps, games, and quiz apps. In order to present a well-rounded set of ups, we could only accept a limited number of each kind.

We hope that you will still be able to attend the MAE event, and actively participate in the Q&A session after each mini-presentation.
