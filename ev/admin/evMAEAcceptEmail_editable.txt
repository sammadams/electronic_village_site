Technology Showcase sessions are typically webcast live.  Please visit www.callis2018.pbworks.com for instructions to access the live webcasts and post-session archived recordings from last year. More information regarding the webcasting of your session will be provided in February 2019. For friends and colleagues who cannot attend in person, please encourage them to tune in live.  Presenters should have their slides and presentations materials ready at least 2 weeks prior to the convention so they can be sent to the webcast team to prepare for the live webcasts.

We hope that you will still be able to attend the MAE event, and actively participate in the Q&A session after each mini-presentation.
