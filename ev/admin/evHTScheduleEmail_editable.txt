You will be presenting with 3 to 4 other presenters. This means you will have about 15 minutes to present your content, with one Q & A session after everyone has presented.

Please be aware that your presentation will be webcast. After the convention, the recording will be globally and freely available. The CALL-IS Webcast Team will contact you in February 2019 with more information about the webcast. To see information and webcasts from last year, visit https://www.callis2018.pbworks.com.
