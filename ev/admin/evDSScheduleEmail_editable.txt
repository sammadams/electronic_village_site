Being accepted is quite an accomplishment as we are limited to only ten presenters. Please read the following information carefully.  
 
Audiovisual Equipment
------------------------
The Electronic Village will provide an LCD projector and screen for your brief presentation/demonstration, equipped with microphones and speakers as you may need. Please come to the Electronic Village as soon as you arrive to the conference in order to see and understand how the venue will be setup.
 
What Happens Next? 
------------------------

Inform all of your co-presenters (if any) that this presentation has been accepted, confirm their participation and let them know when and where the workshop will be presented.
 
Again, we request that presenters check in at the Electronic Village as soon as they arrive at the convention.  This will help ensure that your presentation will go as planned..

Format: Presenters have approximately 8 minutes to demonstrate and/or operate their software and explain its features and applications. A question-and-answer session follows each presentation.

 
Registration and Housing
--------------------------
Go to the TESOL Convention page for more information about registration and housing.

Live Webcasting
--------------------------
Technology Showcase sessions are typically webcast live.  Please visit www.callis2018.pbworks.com for instructions to access the live webcasts and post-session archived recordings from last year.   More information regarding the webcasting of your session will be provided in March 2019. For friends and colleagues who cannot attend in person, please encourage them to tune in live. Presenters should have their slides and presentations materials ready at least 2 weeks prior to the convention so they can be sent to the webcast team to prepare for the live webcasts.
