Thank you for submitting a presentation to the Electronic Village Technology Fair Classics for the TESOL [INSERT YEAR] convention to be held in [INSERT LOCATION].
 
This year, we had more submissions than presentation spots and so we were not able to accommodate all the submissions we received.  We regret to inform you that your presentation was not among those selected.
 
Some presenters sent multiple submissions.  This notice only concerns the specific submission listed below. If you receive an acceptance notice separately, that notice concerns the submission mentioned specifically in that notice.
