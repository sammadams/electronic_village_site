While many excellent proposals could not be included in the program due to the limited number of presentation spots, our readers identified several other factors that affected their evaluation of the appropriateness of a proposal for the Fairs.  Among these were:
 - Some proposals were presentations of papers rather than demonstrations
 - Some proposals didn't specifically indicate what the presenter would demonstrate or included confusing language that made understanding difficult
 - Some proposals had more content that could be covered in the 20-25 minute time limit
 - Some proposals did not clearly indicate how technology would be used in the presentation
 - Some proposals appeared to be commercial promotion for products and the EV Fair is not part of the TESOL marketplace where such promotion belongs.
 - Some presenters had a very narrow window of availability and/or flexibility in terms of computer platforms (Note: this last factor was only considered in addition to the previous four factors.  In no cases did availability or computer preference completely determine acceptance or rejection.)
 
Please examine your proposal to see if any of the above factors might have precluded your proposal from inclusion in the Technology Fairs. We hope you'll be able to use this feedback in writing future proposals.
 
We thank you very much for your submission and hope you'll be able to submit again to the Electronic Village next year.
