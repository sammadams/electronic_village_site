Being accepted is quite an accomplishment as this year we had as many as 55 submissions for only 12 presentations in this event. To ensure that every presentation is of the highest professional quality, we request that you read the following information carefully.  
 
Audiovisual Equipment
------------------------
The Electronic Village will provide an LCD projector and screen for your brief presentation/demonstration and 5 computers equipped with microphones and speakers for the hands-on work by 10-15 participants (2-3 at each computer). We encourage you to bring your own laptop for your presentation; otherwise, only 4 computers will be available to your participants. There will also be space for participants who bring their own laptops.
 
What Happens Next? 
------------------------
Please inform all of your co-presenters (if any) that this presentation has been accepted, confirm their participation and let them know when and where the workshop will be presented.
 
Finally, we request that presenters check in at the Electronic Village as soon as they arrive at the convention.  This will ensure that the needed software has been loaded into the computers and your presentation will go as intended.
