{"id":"1","prop_id":"24","reviewer":"philip.hadlock@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"12|16|15|12|12|67","comments":"Although it contains a number of stylistic, syntactic, and grammatical errors, the general idea of the proposal comes through.  It remains nonetheless quite vague about the particular technologies that will be demonstrated.  There is mention of attendees participating in tasks, but it is quite unclear what pedagogical application of these technologies will be demonstrated and how they relate to ELT."},
{"id":"64","prop_id":"24","reviewer":"hbenucci_tesol@yahoo.com","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"5|18|10|10|10|53","comments":"Poorly written; no clear pedagogical justification or explanation of what exactly would happen in the session\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6an interesting tech topic though  "},
{"id":"2","prop_id":"29","reviewer":"philip.hadlock@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"18|18|18|18|18|90","comments":"The proposal is well written.  It clearly articulates the specific skills that will be demonstrated.  The session's pedagogical value is evident, and its scope has been reasonably defined to ensure that the demonstration can be completed within 90 minutes."},
{"id":"65","prop_id":"29","reviewer":"hbenucci_tesol@yahoo.com","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"16|20|19|19|19|93","comments":"Would benefit from proofreading; good that presenter(s) address supplying Google Cardboard for participant use; seems like a fun, hands-on session with practical classroom applications"},
{"id":"6","prop_id":"31","reviewer":"philip.hadlock@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"19|19|19|17|19|93","comments":"This proposal is well organized and clearly articulates the scope and purpose of the session.  The abstract evidences the presenter's expertise with the mobile learning tools to be demonstrated.  The session promises to offer an informative hands-on experience."},
{"id":"66","prop_id":"31","reviewer":"hbenucci_tesol@yahoo.com","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"17|19|18|15|18|87","comments":"Additional information on the \"social belonging\" aspect would have been helpful\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6also, proposal describes basis for workshop, but doesn't provide a clear outline of how the session would run (hard to judge feasibility). Sounds like an interesting topic that has some testing behind it"},
{"id":"7","prop_id":"33","reviewer":"philip.hadlock@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"15|14|15|13|13|70","comments":"The general idea of the proposal is clear, despite some grammar and syntax errors.  The proposal purports to include some hands-on experience with the product, but it is not clear what pedagogical value this experience will have.  Because the proposal focuses primarily on describing the product development and versions of the product currently on the market without instantiating its applications for ESL, the session's value remains quite ambiguous."},
{"id":"67","prop_id":"33","reviewer":"hbenucci_tesol@yahoo.com","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"14|17|17|15|16|79","comments":"Would benefit from proofreading and less focus on the background of Prezi...session plan isn't clear in terms of time feasibility; also language in the summary oversells a bit \"the most attractive and creative way\"\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6despite no clear links to ELT applications, may be a beneficial session for those who haven't encountered it. "},
{"id":"8","prop_id":"39","reviewer":"philip.hadlock@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"19|19|18|19|19|94","comments":"This is a well written and clearly organized proposal.  It balances a theoretical perspective with practical accounts of the presenter's actual experiences.  This session promises to provide invaluable information with clear applicability."},
{"id":"68","prop_id":"39","reviewer":"hbenucci_tesol@yahoo.com","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"14|16|13|13|17|73","comments":"A rather lengthy list of tools to cover and no explanation of hands-on aspect provided."},
{"id":"9","prop_id":"41","reviewer":"philip.hadlock@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"17|18|18|18|18|89","comments":"This proposal outlines a clear and methodical approach to illustrating the usefulness of Google classroom.  It is reasonable well written.  The session promises to engage participants in hands-on experiences, and should be of interest to participants seeking an introduction to virtual classroom platforms."},
{"id":"165","prop_id":"41","reviewer":"erin.oreilly@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"20|15|20|10|20|85","comments":"This presentation will be of interest to teachers who (1) have a background in Google platforms, but (2) haven't set up a Google LMS. I'm concerned that the presenter(s) will be able to cover everything as described in the workshop abstract. This workshop seems very ambitious. I could see this being several hours depending on who shows up and their skill level, which can be variable. It would be great to see something like this hosted by the TESOL-CALL IS as a webinar series, however. "},
{"id":"10","prop_id":"44","reviewer":"philip.hadlock@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"18|19|19|19|19|94","comments":"This proposal evidences the presenter's theoretical expertise in teaching listening skills and outlines a methodical approach to imparting valuable practical knowledge from that expertise.  The session promises to be of estimable value for attendees seeking to integrate new technological resources into their listening lessons."},
{"id":"166","prop_id":"44","reviewer":"erin.oreilly@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"15|20|20|16|20|91","comments":"This is an interesting proposal. Teachers who specialize in listening will definitely be interested. The workshop summary doesn't capture the last part of the abstract, which is actually what the participants will do. I'm a little concerned that the presenters will be able to present the tools and then also have participants design a lesson plan within 90 minutes. Neat proposal, however! "},
{"id":"53","prop_id":"45","reviewer":"philip.hadlock@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"19|19|19|19|18|94","comments":"The proposal is well written and clearly defines the session's objectives.  The session promises to provide an abundance of hands-on experience.  The presenters have planned the timing carefully to ensure that the session can be completed in the time allotted."},
{"id":"169","prop_id":"45","reviewer":"erin.oreilly@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"16|18|20|18|18|90","comments":"I really like that the presenters are focusing on the meta-awareness aspect that technology can foster. The summary doesn't mention any of the actual tools that they're going to use, so potentially interested attendees may dismiss the workshop because it comes across as vague. I believe that there is sufficient time to accomplish all of the tasks. The presenters may want to be mindful of  discussion time and hands-on time.  "},
{"id":"54","prop_id":"46","reviewer":"philip.hadlock@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"16|16|16|17|17|82","comments":"The proposal is generally comprehensible, although some of the phrasing is a bit infelicitous.  The session proposes to demonstrate an alternative to PowerPoint.  It is a bit vague about the advantages of the tool that will be demonstrated, and thus, it is not entirely clear if it will be of interest to participants.  It is also difficult to determine whether or not the activities have been timed to correspond to the time allotted for the workshop."},
{"id":"167","prop_id":"46","reviewer":"erin.oreilly@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"20|17|20|17|15|89","comments":"I'm intrigued by a presentation given by a Google for Education Certified Teacher. I'm a little concerned that workshop time will be spent presenting their personal projects. Also, the connection to language teaching and language learning isn't transparent. This is still a valuable tool and a potentially valuable workshop for TESOL."},
{"id":"55","prop_id":"47","reviewer":"philip.hadlock@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"18|18|18|16|17|87","comments":"The proposal is clearly written and addresses a topic that should be of interest to many participants.  Given the scope of the topic and description of the extensive demonstrations, there is some concern that it will not be feasible to complete everything in the allotted time.  The proposal purports to engage the session participants in hands-on activities to cement their understanding of the concepts to be presented."},
{"id":"175","prop_id":"47","reviewer":"erin.oreilly@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"15|17|20|15|18|85","comments":"I've read this proposal several times, and I'm still not entirely clear what these guides are. The proposal discusses several software tools. Do these require previous experience or knowledge on the part of the participant? I'm concerned that the presenter(s) have sufficient time to present the content, transfer the knowledge, and have enough time for participants to complete the project. I do think it's good that they're using pre-developed templates. Interesting. I'm curious to learn more."},
{"id":"59","prop_id":"55","reviewer":"philip.hadlock@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"18|18|18|19|18|91","comments":"The proposal is clearly written and addresses a topic of high interest.  The session promises to offer a good deal of hands-on experience.  The presenter has carefully planned the timing to complete the workshop in 90 minutes."},
{"id":"177","prop_id":"55","reviewer":"erin.oreilly@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"19|20|20|20|20|99","comments":"I like that the abstract reassures us that you can complete a project in 30 minutes. Recommend mentioning your specific software in the summary so that attendees know exactly what they'll be working with. I would be interested in attending this session and know that I'll walk away with new skills."},
{"id":"62","prop_id":"57","reviewer":"philip.hadlock@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"19|18|18|17|18|90","comments":"The proposal is well written and theoretically sound.  It promises to be of interest to participants seeking new methods to teach vocabulary.  Hands-on activities will be included.  It is a bit unclear if the presenter has worked out the timing to ensure that the session can be completed in 90 minutes."},
{"id":"170","prop_id":"57","reviewer":"erin.oreilly@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"18|18|20|20|20|96","comments":"Recommend minor editing if workshop is selected prior to publication. I've never heard of Adobe Spark, so this is new for me! Is this better\/easier\/flashier than Quizzlet or similar programs? I'm excited to learn, but also want to know what's unique about Adobe Spark from existing tools. Also, will there be sufficient time to do both the app and online versions of the tool? Interesting."},
{"id":"106","prop_id":"65","reviewer":"susangaer@gmail.com","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"20|20|20|20|20|100","comments":"Looks like a great workshop. Structured and using one app with solid based research"},
{"id":"168","prop_id":"65","reviewer":"erin.oreilly@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"20|10|20|20|20|90","comments":"This is a solid workshop design. The content to be covered is reasonable in terms of scope. Memrise has been around for awhile, so the novel aspect of it really is in the presenters' best-practices. If it isn't included in the conference proceedings, I would encourage the presenters to look into the possibility of a webinar through the CALL-IS, or to contribute to the CALL-IS newsletter."},
{"id":"107","prop_id":"75","reviewer":"susangaer@gmail.com","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"20|20|20|20|20|100","comments":"I doubt that participants will be able to print their designs. I wish they would be able to do this."},
{"id":"163","prop_id":"75","reviewer":"erin.oreilly@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"20|20|20|20|15|95","comments":"This seems like a fantastic, unique presentation and it would be well-attended for those teachers working to promote STEM in the curriculum. The only concern is that there isn't an explicit link to language. This may be rolled into the \"areas that students have struggled with conceptually in class,\" but I'm unsure. If the workshop is selected, I would encourage the presenters to make this connection explicit."},
{"id":"108","prop_id":"80","reviewer":"susangaer@gmail.com","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"20|15|20|20|20|95","comments":"Looks like a solid presentation on an easy to use mind mapping software. "},
{"id":"164","prop_id":"80","reviewer":"erin.oreilly@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"20|18|20|18|20|96","comments":"I believe this proposal will be of interest to writing teachers."},
{"id":"109","prop_id":"88","reviewer":"susangaer@gmail.com","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"15|10|10|20|20|75","comments":"Nearpod is not a free program. It is rather expensive and although it does make Powerpoints interactive, I fear not to many participants will be able to afford it."},
{"id":"118","prop_id":"88","reviewer":"philip.hadlock@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"13|14|14|13|13|67","comments":"The proposal is quite muddled and its theoretical framing of the concepts to be presented in the workshop is very unclear."},
{"id":"110","prop_id":"91","reviewer":"susangaer@gmail.com","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"14|20|10|20|17|81","comments":"I don't see enough hands on here. The way it is written, it sounds like it is mostly a demo."},
{"id":"119","prop_id":"91","reviewer":"philip.hadlock@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"17|17|16|17|16|83","comments":"The proposal presents a concept of potential interest to L2 writing instructors, but is rather ambiguous as to how the learning platform to be demonstrated in the session will change current practices. "},
{"id":"111","prop_id":"94","reviewer":"susangaer@gmail.com","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"20|20|20|5|20|85","comments":"I am not sure if they will be able to do all this in 90 minutes. That is my biggest question. According to the description, they will be creating a magazine with multiple articles?"},
{"id":"143","prop_id":"94","reviewer":"philip.hadlock@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"18|19|17|17|18|89","comments":"This is a new and original idea that will potentially be of great interest to participants.  It is unclear whether or not the presenter(s) have worked out the timing of the presentation.  The proposal is also rather vague about whether or not participants will have an opportunity to use the demonstrated tools themselves."},
{"id":"112","prop_id":"96","reviewer":"susangaer@gmail.com","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"20|5|15|20|15|75","comments":"Weebly has been around for quite a while. So it may not be high interest to CALL enthusiasts."},
{"id":"144","prop_id":"96","reviewer":"philip.hadlock@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"17|16|16|17|16|82","comments":"The session may be of some general interest.  The proposal would be more engaging had the presenters focused on a particular application or methodological issue rather than a generic webpage building workshop."},
{"id":"113","prop_id":"99","reviewer":"susangaer@gmail.com","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"20|20|20|20|20|100","comments":"Sounds like a great mini workshop which I would attend."},
{"id":"148","prop_id":"99","reviewer":"philip.hadlock@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"18|18|18|18|18|90","comments":"The proposed session will provide practical orientation on using new technologies to enrich multiliteracy training.  The proposal evidences the presenters theoretical knowledge and promises to engage participants in hands-on exercises."},

It promises to offer some hands-on experience.  It is unclear how the presenter views the pedagogical value of this software."},
{"id":"115","prop_id":"106","reviewer":"susangaer@gmail.com","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"20|5|14|5|20|64","comments":"Maybe a little too easy and not really much for 90 mins. I think this could be done as a presentation. This is less than a 90 min presentation."},
{"id":"162","prop_id":"106","reviewer":"philip.hadlock@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"18|15|18|18|17|86","comments":"The proposed session focuses on a language learning technology tool that is not particularly new, but might be of interest to participants interested in taking initial steps into introducing some basic language learning technology into their curricula."},
{"id":"116","prop_id":"114","reviewer":"susangaer@gmail.com","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"5|5|5|10|10|35","comments":"I watched the video and I noticed a few things. \r\n1) Cambridge seems to be sponsoring this\r\n2) The purpose of the 360 video is to help teacher training. I am not sure why the video has to be 360 for this.\r\n3) How are they taking the 360 video? This usually requires a special camera. 360 photos you can take with a phone, but not video."},
{"id":"205","prop_id":"114","reviewer":"philip.hadlock@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"18|19|18|18|19|92","comments":"This proposed workshop promises to highlight a unique issue.  It should be of interest to any participants seeking new strategies for assessing performance and teaching effectiveness."},
{"id":"117","prop_id":"115","reviewer":"susangaer@gmail.com","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"5|10|6|20|20|61","comments":"This presentation does not describe what games it will use. I would need to know what these are in order to rate it. Also the abstract is confusing and hard to read. A lot of words that don't describe what will be covered."},
{"id":"206","prop_id":"115","reviewer":"philip.hadlock@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"16|18|16|15|16|81","comments":"The proposal is somewhat disorganized and seems to conflate a number of different issues.  It may contain some very compelling video game demonstrations, but the presenters do not seem to have defined the scope of the presentation such that it can be adequately or effectively addressed in a 90-minute workshop."},
{"id":"211","prop_id":"118","reviewer":"philip.hadlock@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"18|19|18|18|19|92","comments":"The proposal is clear and the proposed workshop well-conceived. It promises to offer substantial hands-on experience in using corpora for developing vocabulary lessons."},
{"id":"330","prop_id":"118","reviewer":"deborah.kennedy@key-words.us","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"17|18|20|18|17|90","comments":"This is an important topic that will be of value to all teachers working with learners at and above the low intermediate level. It has broad reach, incorporating options for classrooms both with and without computer access. It has a good balance of demonstration and hands-on experiential activity."},
{"id":"505","prop_id":"118","reviewer":"jmay@valenciacollege.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"16|15|16|16|13|76","comments":"I would have liked to have seen more support for pedagogical soundness and how you are going to make it hands on\/engaging  for participants. "},

{"id":"331","prop_id":"121","reviewer":"deborah.kennedy@key-words.us","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"10|13|6|18|5|52","comments":"This proposal is written in marketing language and does not indicate the pedagogical basis for its claims. The session is described as a demonstration rather than an actual hands-on workshop. The topic (developing skills in English while maintaining skills in another language) is timely and important, but the description does not clarify how the curriculum promotes language skill development or content knowledge."},

The proposal is a bit vague as to the technology's specific application to language learning classrooms.

It promises to introduce participants to a novel gamification platform that may be of great interest.  Indicating that attendees \"will [...] participate in a game,\" the proposal implies that some hands-on experience will be involved, but it remains a bit unclear as to how central these experiences will be to the workshop."},
