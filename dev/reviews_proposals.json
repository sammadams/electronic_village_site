The goal of this is to help learners to understand what expressions may be viewed as polite or impolite in an academic advising session so that they may make informed decisions as to how to present themselves. This differs from an approach that treats polite expressions as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccorrect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcimpolite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expressions as incorrect.\r\n     The presentation will focus on the feedback features implemented in the advising simulation, as well as the rationale for including these features.

In 2017-19, K-12 teachers (n=50) from three school districts participated in Saturday Seminars and graduate-level TESOL coursework. After each Saturday Seminar, teacher candidates were required to submit blog postings to continue their interest and discussion as a professional community. Using Yin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (2009) qualitative case study research framework, multiple data sources from the Saturday Seminars have been collected and triangulated (Lincoln & Guba, 1985) to ensure credibility. Based on the 107 blog postings collected for two years, three themes emerged from the blog, and they are: 1) Interdiscursivity fostered through blogging, 2) Professional blog as heteroglossic space (Blair, Haneda, and Bose, 2018), and 3) Shared teacher identity building with blogging. The most important finding concerns interdiscursivity (Davis, 2008), in which teacher candidates were empowered to re-envision their participation as interdiscursive, that the discourses \u00e2\u20ac\u0153intersect, overlap, and interlace\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (p. 57) as they respond to each other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s postings using various discursive strategies.

The research to answer this question is  just beginning.  Smeets and Bus, 2015 have indicated that quality e-books with picture cues and well-written narration support comprehension.  Barnyqk & MCNelty, 2016; Brommel, Moran & Wooten, 2015 indicate that well-written e-books support children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vocabulary development, especially e-books with build in multimedia features to access word pronunciation.  It is particularly helpful to young learners to have pictures, words, and pronunciation present on an e-book page.  \r\n\r\nE-books, unlike their print counterpart require different motor skills to accomplish page turning. Teachers need to become familiar with the multimedia and technological features of e-books.   Choosing effective e-books for early childhood English learners require teachers to examine the technical features that allow for ease of operability, as well as control options for parents and teachers. \r\n\r\nThe presenter discusses three selection criteria  components:  operability, emergent and early literacy features, and instructional design of e-books using a sample e-book for young English learners. She shares an expanded checklist of these three selection criteria and discusses multimedia features in e-books which could be a distraction to the English learner.   A list of early childhood e-books is shared.\r\n","password":"4590864142ad8018a2dba06f809894a558e1087e16f3e758def8574c652351e408994f5e42fc7cd08ebfa822e01e6f0f376875eff517e10a981588e99f67620c","salt":"5ac5a3cdc0bcf69b7c68a67fe876eb0615a13c0be56225e2ab42dac12cc8e940aa16885e0994cebf08a580ebfa8534277a524c5b85007f9e1816cf274e659ba2","comments":"Can I use my iPad or MAC to demonstrate, if my proposal is selected?","photoOK":"1","emailOK":"1","type":"Hot Topics","status":"accepted","confirmed":"Y"},

CT represents an approach to solving problems using concepts essential to computing. It involves the ability to formulate thoughts in a manner that is communicable to a computer to achieve desired results (Wing, 2006). Success in this dynamic workforce requires students to think computationally and navigate multiple levels of abstraction to find innovative solutions for perplexing problems. Yet as one of the fastest growing populations in US schools, language learners remain dramatically underrepresented in computer courses and careers (Martin, McAlear, & Scott 2015). Schools serving greater numbers of language learners offer half as many computer science courses as those serving fewer language learners (Martin & McAlear, 2015).

Leaners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 lookup notes and questionnaire responses revealed interesting findings about the extent to which online dictionaries and corpora could support learners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 autonomous MWE acquisition.","abstract":"Research has recently emphasized the pedagogical significance of multiword expressions (MWEs) (e.g. Boers & Lindstromberg, 2012; Ellis, 2012). Yet, with limited class time and the sheer number of MWEs available for learning, a substantial part of learners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 MWE acquisition may have to rely teachers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 efforts to equip learners with strategies that foster autonomous learning (Nation, 2013).\r\nIn this study, 26 Vietnamese English-major second-year students were trained to do text-chunking activities, in which they intuitively extract MWEs from authentic texts. To verify their intuition, students were instructed to use online dictionaries and the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) (Davies, 2008-). The eleven-week study time includes an awareness-raising workshop on MWEs and ten reading sessions of students\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 text-chunking and autonomous lookup with a simplified COCA manual provided. Students\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 weekly lookup worksheets were collected, and immediate and delayed questionnaires were administered to investigate students\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 perception of the use of online dictionaries and COCA for their MWE acquisition. Analysis of students\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 worksheets revealed a surprisingly low success rate of their lookup. Responses to the questionnaires indicated students\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 perceptions about the benefits and the difficulties they face when using the introduced resources.

One potential pedagogical path is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctext-chunking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, an activity where learners are asked to identify MWEs in authentic texts (Boers, Eyckmans, Kappel, Stengers and Demecheleer, 2006). \r\nThis talk reports on a conceptual replication study whereby participants were two intact classes of Vietnamese EFL learners in their second year of tertiary education. Over the course of ten weeks, the experimental group (n=26) engaged in weekly text-chunking practice, while a comparison group (n=30) used the same reading materials for content-related activities.  In a departure from Boers et al. (2006), the experimental group was taught strategies to verify their identification of MWEs: consulting online dictionaries and an online corpus. A pre-test and two post-tests (immediate and delayed) on 52 target items revealed significantly greater learning gains in the experimental group, with a medium effect size. Inspections of learners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 notes on lexical items to learn also indicates the experimental group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s superior awareness of MWEs.

The use of digital technologies and integration of different semiotic, visual, and audio elements in composition hold promise for increasing the writing achievement of L2 learners, but little is known about the process of multimodal composing and its impact on improving writing skills and fostering rhetorical knowledge in the L2 classroom. Understanding if and how multimodal composition might foster rhetorical knowledge and improve writing skills without diverting language learners from building their linguistic skills is crucial. My research project seeks to explore two major questions of pedagogical import: (1) how might the affordances of multiple semiotic features complement alphabetic writing? and (2) how can writing instructors harness multimodal tools, without diverting L2 learners from building their linguistic skills, to improve the rhetorical knowledge and writing development of L2 learners?

In the Middle East, many undergraduates struggle in composition courses especially those whose L1 is Arabic. They struggle in writing English whether it is because of the different orthography, Grammar, lexis, discourse, language mechanics (spelling, punctuation, capitalization, paragraphs division, etc.) or because their mother tongue influences their L2 writing production process. Therefore, the current thesis aims at comparing persuasive essay writing among native and non-native writers of English where there is specific focus on comparing Arab learners' essays to their American peers. The study focused on discourse analysis to explore the rhetorical features of students' essays and aimed at exploring the current teaching practice efficiency as well as students' wants and needs in composition courses.

The researchers introduce the history of technology and its importance in education. The study divides technology into three aspects, communicative, collaborative, and creative tools. The researchers examine learners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 perspectives, awareness, and preferences of employing these tools in English learning.\r\n","abstract":"\r\nIn the past, the usage of technology was very limited and controlled by few experts. Web 1.0 was an example of how technology was used by the United States army for a specific purpose. People were not able to interact or collaborate through web1.0. However, in 2004, Web 2.0 emerged and the term Web 2.0 was given to describe a second generation of the World Wide Web. It basically focuses on the ability of people to communicate, collaborate, and create information online. It has gained great attention among teenagers and university students. Web 2.0 is considered as an important instrument in language learning in many educational systems. The researcher investigates the English language learners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 attitudes about employing this modern technology in TESOL. To make the study more focused, the researcher chooses examples for each technological tool in the questionnaire. He uses Facebook as a communicative tool, Wikipedia as a collaborative tool, and YouTube as a creative tool. The results show that learners are aware of the benefits of using technology in English language learning. YouTube is the most preferable tool in learning English among students. They also use Facebook in English to interact with their international friends and classmates. \r\n","password":"20ec114c038aa9bcb6c9dc439a70d4435120b920831b2b551b44cc40a5b48e0741fcd5c0992b3533caa773bbc55522e9f5005d667497362251756d221279c79b","salt":"fa288d1e22eae36b0c0c3c4fcfb787220a3464f8236afe61f5e49061bf138277595cf215a88c3f62209820a825be6941328b2bfed0b141148e031fe72df72d9b","comments":"","photoOK":"1","emailOK":"1","type":"Graduate Student Research","status":"rejected","confirmed":"?"},

There are many aspects of vocabulary depth, such as its spelling, pronunciation and register. For this study, I designed an online productive vocabulary test measuring depth of knowledge targeting problematic yet common types of English words and phrases. The aspects of vocabulary knowledge which will be tested are polysemous nouns, idioms and frequent collocations. Polysemous nouns have different meaning senses which can only be determined from the context and\/or collocations in which they are used. Every vocabulary item on this test is within the 1000 most common words on the New General Service List (Browne, C., Culligan, B. & Phillips, J., 2013). This assessment includes cloze and multiple-choice type questions, and each item has only one correct answer.

","abstract":"The ability to read and comprehend passages at intermediate proficiency levels has been recognized as being critical in assisting adult immigrant students. Therefore, instruction in reading should be given in the most interactive format possible (Goodman, 1967). My research shows online reading provides an opportunity for students to interact with academic texts in compelling ways; however, there are challenges to the use of modern technology wherein readers are overloaded by the materials. Based on the psycholinguistic theories, online academic texts may use multiple sources of information to promote reading comprehension if the multi-modal does not exceed the working memory (Hinkle, 2011). Thus, L2 educators have vital roles in helping students benefit from the existing technological tools in addition to teaching meta(cognitive) online reading strategies. This presentation elaborates on the effects of the use of technologies in reading instructions and highlight their different uses and effects on reading strategies and comprehension. It also examines different ways of using technology to support adult learners attain meta(cognitive) reading skills.

Likewise, the opinion of the students about their own practices of alternation of languages in the communicative activities they carry out is examined. Finally, after the analysis of these evaluations, we try to determine the coherence between the sociolinguistic representations and the plurilingual practices of the students of the Foreign Language Career of the UNAH. This study was approached following the common thread of two hypotheses, which guided the data collection, as well as the analysis of the results. The first hypothesis stated that \"The preference for singular approaches is part of the representations of the students and teachers of the Foreign Languages Career\". The second hypothesis considered that \"the students of the Foreign Language Career have a plurilingual life, although not necessarily a plurilingual consciousness. based on these results, the need to reevaluate the whole process through which the teaching-learning of languages takes place is recognized.","password":"d075ed69fa57a4a542a112fca6185cf5836a94f92b9d6ca30db01cef3ed39b63da25b7ed244888973c8a22a5bdb9d788bc87b76dfe9428244191e23e08a73cf6","salt":"042d78f33bdda2f9e0d11ae68762a1eca17cef8830f48d0b12fb615afbd8a8b2c08d0249a8cf8810fc3661ae701d6a5f3b3a0e341fd7259c476f084817ae33a9","comments":"","photoOK":"1","emailOK":"1","type":"Graduate Student Research","status":"rejected","confirmed":"?"},
