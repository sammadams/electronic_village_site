{"id":"1","prop_id":"24","reviewer":"philip.hadlock@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"12|16|15|12|12|67","comments":"Although it contains a number of stylistic, syntactic, and grammatical errors, the general idea of the proposal comes through.  It remains nonetheless quite vague about the particular technologies that will be demonstrated.  There is mention of attendees participating in tasks, but it is quite unclear what pedagogical application of these technologies will be demonstrated and how they relate to ELT."},
{"id":"2","prop_id":"29","reviewer":"philip.hadlock@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"18|18|18|18|18|90","comments":"The proposal is well written.  It clearly articulates the specific skills that will be demonstrated.  The session's pedagogical value is evident, and its scope has been reasonably defined to ensure that the demonstration can be completed within 90 minutes."},
{"id":"3","prop_id":"229","reviewer":"sandylw303@yahoo.com","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"5|4|10|15|1|35","comments":"This presentation seems to be trying to incorporate multi-media and blogging. Additoinally the use Accumulative is a bit misleading and not used in the proper context.  It is difficult to determine if the presenters will be presenting on blogging or the selection of interactive materials.  Not sure how these two come together.  "},

{"id":"5","prop_id":"238","reviewer":"sandylw303@yahoo.com","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"19|19|19|20|20|97","comments":"Keep. This is well written and offers a very beneficial application for others to learn about and apply to teaching practice."},
{"id":"6","prop_id":"31","reviewer":"philip.hadlock@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"19|19|19|17|19|93","comments":"This proposal is well organized and clearly articulates the scope and purpose of the session.  The abstract evidences the presenter's expertise with the mobile learning tools to be demonstrated.  The session promises to offer an informative hands-on experience."},
{"id":"7","prop_id":"33","reviewer":"philip.hadlock@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"15|14|15|13|13|70","comments":"The general idea of the proposal is clear, despite some grammar and syntax errors.  The proposal purports to include some hands-on experience with the product, but it is not clear what pedagogical value this experience will have.  Because the proposal focuses primarily on describing the product development and versions of the product currently on the market without instantiating its applications for ESL, the session's value remains quite ambiguous."},
{"id":"8","prop_id":"39","reviewer":"philip.hadlock@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"19|19|18|19|19|94","comments":"This is a well written and clearly organized proposal.  It balances a theoretical perspective with practical accounts of the presenter's actual experiences.  This session promises to provide invaluable information with clear applicability."},
{"id":"9","prop_id":"41","reviewer":"philip.hadlock@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"17|18|18|18|18|89","comments":"This proposal outlines a clear and methodical approach to illustrating the usefulness of Google classroom.  It is reasonable well written.  The session promises to engage participants in hands-on experiences, and should be of interest to participants seeking an introduction to virtual classroom platforms."},
{"id":"10","prop_id":"44","reviewer":"philip.hadlock@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"18|19|19|19|19|94","comments":"This proposal evidences the presenter's theoretical expertise in teaching listening skills and outlines a methodical approach to imparting valuable practical knowledge from that expertise.  The session promises to be of estimable value for attendees seeking to integrate new technological resources into their listening lessons."},
{"id":"11","prop_id":"186","reviewer":"hbenucci_tesol@yahoo.com","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"14|18|14|14|17|77","comments":"While a virtual Toastmasters platform seems quite interesting, the proposal was vague at times in terms of what participants would be doing, and it seems like there is lots of room for \"day of\" glitches depending on how the distance participants in the live platform demo is coordinated"},
{"id":"12","prop_id":"195","reviewer":"hbenucci_tesol@yahoo.com","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"16|18|14|14|18|80","comments":"Topic has broad appeal; seems like a helpful array of resources; however, It was a bit unclear as to what participants would be doing with the tools and how many tools would be presented.  Based on the timing plan here, there might not be enough time allotted for meaningful participant practice with the tools depending on what is going to be covered (how to use tool in general vs. how to use w\/ students)"},
{"id":"13","prop_id":"190","reviewer":"hbenucci_tesol@yahoo.com","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"10|18|8|15|18|69","comments":"Covers pronunciation instruction uses of a popular app, but proposal would benefit from proofreading; presenter doesn't mention what participants will do in terms of hands-on practice"},
{"id":"14","prop_id":"197","reviewer":"hbenucci_tesol@yahoo.com","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"19|20|20|20|18|97","comments":"Likely a new tool for many; potentially broad relevance; clear proposal + plan outline seems achievable "},
{"id":"15","prop_id":"200","reviewer":"hbenucci_tesol@yahoo.com","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"17|15|20|20|20|92","comments":"Information in abstract was redundant at times; Wordle and word clouds are fairly well known tools\/concepts, but it seems like these presenters may have some new pedagogical approaches to share"},
{"id":"16","prop_id":"208","reviewer":"hbenucci_tesol@yahoo.com","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"16|19|15|20|20|90","comments":"Though I disagree with the definition of digital storytelling presented in the abstract; this proposal covers an interesting approach to creating trailers for books\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6tool presented is not free\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6will be curious how the participants will use during session without paying unless presenter has a multiseat license"},
{"id":"17","prop_id":"210","reviewer":"hbenucci_tesol@yahoo.com","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"12|18|15|15|15|75","comments":"would benefit from proofreading; workshop plan and participant actions were not clearly explained; however, flipping is still a high-interest topic"},
{"id":"18","prop_id":"217","reviewer":"hbenucci_tesol@yahoo.com","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"13|19|15|15|15|77","comments":"Proposal was a bit unclear at times (used \"students\" to signify \"participants\" in places?) and seemed to skip mention of YouTube (in abstract) and how the Storylabs app would in incorporated in the workshop.  Difficult to judge timing with Storylabs app aspect missing "},
{"id":"19","prop_id":"222","reviewer":"hbenucci_tesol@yahoo.com","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"18|18|17|20|18|91","comments":"Though potentially more appealing to ESL vs. EFL audiences, sounds like an interesting way to pair intercultural awareness with tech tools; catchy title; hands-on aspect for participants could have been more clearly explained"},

{"id":"21","prop_id":"225","reviewer":"hbenucci_tesol@yahoo.com","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"15|19|20|18|17|89","comments":"I like that they factored in account creation time into the outline; would benefit from proofreading and information about how they are measuring\/defining \"oracy growth\""},
{"id":"22","prop_id":"232","reviewer":"sandylw303@yahoo.com","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"10|10|14|4|3|41","comments":"Too many tech resources to effectively learn and apply.  I am not sure what the presenter means by technology illumination unless it is discovery. The activities seem disconnected and just a way to use each resource. Needs a better focus."},

{"id":"24","prop_id":"241","reviewer":"sandylw303@yahoo.com","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"1|2|1|1|1|6","comments":"Presentation; no interaction. Tech Fair"},
{"id":"25","prop_id":"245","reviewer":"sandylw303@yahoo.com","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"9|17|10|1|10|47","comments":"Seems like a lot for 90 minutes. NO indication of hands on"},

{"id":"28","prop_id":"222","reviewer":"dianna.lippincott@asu.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"15|15|5|5|5|45","comments":"The topic is clear and convincing, very applicable to the audience.  The technologies mentioned are recent and good choices; however, they are listed as \"such as,\" not the actual technologies to be used.  There is no \"how.\"  What will the presenters do?  How are these tools used to reach the goal of addressing personal biases?"},

{"id":"30","prop_id":"225","reviewer":"dianna.lippincott@asu.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"15|15|18|15|15|78","comments":"Proposal is clearly written and includes the exact steps to describe what participants will do.  Excellent that mention is made that the technology is free, as this will help attract attendees to the session, as well as dealing with a topic that is always of interest to teachers--evaluation."},
{"id":"31","prop_id":"229","reviewer":"dianna.lippincott@asu.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"15|14|5|5|10|49","comments":"This is a topic that is often covered, but this proposal makes it sound fresh and inviting.  However, it is unclear what the hands-on experience will be and whether the attendees will create something that they can take away.  Because of this, it is difficult to know if the session can be completed within the 90 minute time."},

{"id":"33","prop_id":"232","reviewer":"dianna.lippincott@asu.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"12|12|18|15|13|70","comments":"This proposal is very specific about the tools that will be used and what attendees will do with the tools.  Attendees will set up their own activities in these tools before leaving the session, so they will return to their classroom with ready-to-use lessons."},

{"id":"35","prop_id":"238","reviewer":"dianna.lippincott@asu.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"15|14|7|5|13|54","comments":"The topic of using Padlet to spark sharing writing is a good topic, but since Padlet is not a new application, many attendees may have already encountered it.  It is simple to use, so this reviewer wonders if there is a full 90-minute workshop in this proposal.  This would be excellent for a Technology Fair presentation."},
{"id":"36","prop_id":"241","reviewer":"dianna.lippincott@asu.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"15|15|3|5|15|53","comments":"This session sounds interesting--both the topic and content; however, it does not fit the workshop format.  The presenters will demonstrate their methods and provide a guide, rather than having participants complete the activities themselves."},
{"id":"37","prop_id":"245","reviewer":"dianna.lippincott@asu.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"15|15|5|5|10|50","comments":"The topic of transforming a class from f2f to online is a timely one that would be of interest to conference attendees.  However, a mini-workshop should contain hands-on activities, and this proposal does not make clear what those activities or what products will be developed during the workshop.  The topic of overall course transformation is too broad for a 90-minute workshop."},
{"id":"38","prop_id":"246","reviewer":"dianna.lippincott@asu.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"17|17|17|17|17|85","comments":"Kahoot is a fairly common app with which many conference attendees will have had experience.  This proposal delves deeper and engages participants in creating ready-to-use projects that make use of lesser-known functions in the app.  Moving beyond the basics will be appealing to attendees."},
{"id":"39","prop_id":"247","reviewer":"dianna.lippincott@asu.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"13|10|15|10|15|63","comments":"Digital Bulletin Boards, such as Padlet, are becoming more commonplace, and the angle of comparing various tools is of interest.  However, they are generally very intuitive and easy to use, so this presentation probably won't need a full 90-minute session.  This proposal would be ideal for a technology fair presentation."},
{"id":"40","prop_id":"101","reviewer":"jennylynn41069@gmail.com","event":"Hot Topics","review":"1|2|2|3|8","comments":"I'm not sure this is a Hot Topic.  This could be more useful as a Technology Fair perhaps."},
{"id":"41","prop_id":"155","reviewer":"jennylynn41069@gmail.com","event":"Hot Topics","review":"3|3|3|3|12","comments":"This proposal is well-organized and cutting-edge."},
{"id":"42","prop_id":"173","reviewer":"jennylynn41069@gmail.com","event":"Hot Topics","review":"2|3|2|2|9","comments":"This sounds like an interesting topic that could be practical information for other practitioners in developing countries."},
{"id":"43","prop_id":"221","reviewer":"jennylynn41069@gmail.com","event":"Hot Topics","review":"3|3|3|3|12","comments":"This sounds like a developer's showcase session."},
{"id":"44","prop_id":"253","reviewer":"jennylynn41069@gmail.com","event":"Hot Topics","review":"2|3|2|1|8","comments":"This sounds like a Technology Fair session.  None of the tools that will be demonstrated have been named, so the quality of the session cannot be properly evaluated."},

{"id":"53","prop_id":"45","reviewer":"philip.hadlock@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"19|19|19|19|18|94","comments":"The proposal is well written and clearly defines the session's objectives.  The session promises to provide an abundance of hands-on experience.  The presenters have planned the timing carefully to ensure that the session can be completed in the time allotted."},
{"id":"54","prop_id":"46","reviewer":"philip.hadlock@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"16|16|16|17|17|82","comments":"The proposal is generally comprehensible, although some of the phrasing is a bit infelicitous.  The session proposes to demonstrate an alternative to PowerPoint.  It is a bit vague about the advantages of the tool that will be demonstrated, and thus, it is not entirely clear if it will be of interest to participants.  It is also difficult to determine whether or not the activities have been timed to correspond to the time allotted for the workshop."},
{"id":"55","prop_id":"47","reviewer":"philip.hadlock@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"18|18|18|16|17|87","comments":"The proposal is clearly written and addresses a topic that should be of interest to many participants.  Given the scope of the topic and description of the extensive demonstrations, there is some concern that it will not be feasible to complete everything in the allotted time.  The proposal purports to engage the session participants in hands-on activities to cement their understanding of the concepts to be presented."},
{"id":"56","prop_id":"16","reviewer":"jack.watson@unb.ca","event":"Technology Fairs","review":"4","comments":"An interesting application of technology to a challenging aspect of English training. The following improvements are suggested: The proposal needs a clear explanation of what the presenter considers suprasegmentals to be; the presenter needs to establish a logical link between the first and second sentences of the abstract (unless none exists, in which case a word like 'moreover' is apropos); and the final sentence should be clarified through removal of unnecessary words or ideas, or division into two sentences."},
{"id":"57","prop_id":"28","reviewer":"samadams.tesol@gmail.com","event":"Technology Fairs","review":"2","comments":"The first sentence of the abstract is not clear. I had to read it a few times to make sense of what the author was trying to say. The presenters will "},
{"id":"59","prop_id":"55","reviewer":"philip.hadlock@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"18|18|18|19|18|91","comments":"The proposal is clearly written and addresses a topic of high interest.  The session promises to offer a good deal of hands-on experience.  The presenter has carefully planned the timing to complete the workshop in 90 minutes."},
{"id":"60","prop_id":"38","reviewer":"samadams.tesol@gmail.com","event":"Technology Fairs","review":"4","comments":"The scope of this proposal is not explicit enough. That is, the fact that this is an administrative use of the tool should be clearly stated in the abstract. Not all programs require such lesson plan submissions, so the author should not assume that readers will understand this dynamic. Moreover, I would recommend weakening the statement in the beginning of the summary: \"...an interactive free app that can increase teachers' motivation to...\" However, the description of the sequencing of the session is clear."},
{"id":"58","prop_id":"37","reviewer":"samadams.tesol@gmail.com","event":"Technology Fairs","review":"6","comments":"Clear description of the outcome and format of this presentation. The content seems relevant to a wide range of instructors and the abstract provides a precise idea of what to expect."},
{"id":"61","prop_id":"40","reviewer":"samadams.tesol@gmail.com","event":"Technology Fairs","review":"5","comments":"Both the summary and abstract are clear in the scope and outcome of the presentation. However, I would recommend cleaning up the first sentence of the summary, since it could be confusing to some readers. Is YouTube the primary source of media accessible via PlayPosit? I would use the name of the site (\"on YouTube and similar sites\") instead of \"on popular video sites\". Pay attention possibly confusing vocabulary usage: you use \"means\" in two different senses in back-to-back sentences."},
{"id":"62","prop_id":"57","reviewer":"philip.hadlock@dliflc.edu","event":"Mini-Workshops","review":"19|18|18|17|18|90","comments":"The proposal is well written and theoretically sound.  It promises to be of interest to participants seeking new methods to teach vocabulary.  Hands-on activities will be included.  It is a bit unclear if the presenter has worked out the timing to ensure that the session can be completed in 90 minutes."},
{"id":"63","prop_id":"42","reviewer":"samadams.tesol@gmail.com","event":"Technology Fairs","review":"6","comments":"Very clear description of the scope, outcomes, and sequencing of this presentation. No changes needed. "},

Since an audience might justifiably ask whether a skill can be created or customized, this reviewer suggests that the terms \"customized skill\" and \"create a basic skill\" be clarified or replaced, or \"skill\" be defined. "},
{"id":"216","prop_id":"25","reviewer":"jack.watson@unb.ca","event":"Technology Fairs","review":"6","comments":"Acceptance is recommended. The proposal is clearly written, the technology adequately described, and objectives set. No changes are needed."},
{"id":"217","prop_id":"27","reviewer":"jack.watson@unb.ca","event":"Technology Fairs","review":"5","comments":"The subject matter focus is clear, the benefits of the platform use are stated, and the content is supported with research. The proposal could be improved with a stronger statement of presentation objectives and outcomes, as well as removal of the first two sentences of the abstract (unnecessary since they could serve to introduce any presentation in the EV). Infelicities like the comma after \"such as\" in the summary should be addressed."},
{"id":"218","prop_id":"23","reviewer":"jack.watson@unb.ca","event":"Technology Fairs","review":"5","comments":"An intriguing perspective of a widely-used platform, the proposal will appeal to any frequent presenter who appreciates time economy. Recommend for acceptance, with the following changes: 1. hyphenating \"commonly used\" in the summary will smooth out that sentence's reading. 2. Rewriting \"However, knowing very little about how to use these resources is a waste of one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s precious time and energy\" is suggested, since time not deployed cannot really be considered to be time wasted. A more positive slant will clarify the writer's intent."},

{"id":"229","prop_id":"56","reviewer":"samadams.tesol@gmail.com","event":"Technology Fairs","review":"2","comments":"This proposal exceeded the word limit, so I am unable to evaluate the merit of the content. Also, it does not seem to match the Technology Fair format and seems more relevant as an academic presentation of practice-based research."},
{"id":"230","prop_id":"49","reviewer":"samadams.tesol@gmail.com","event":"Technology Fairs","review":"5","comments":"The summary could more clearly identify if this is primarily a tool for teachers or students. Is this intended to be used as a pedagogical tool during lessons or something that students can use at home? It appears that is geared towards teachers only based on the \"...for use as examples and for creating activities.\" It would be best to clarify the intended user of the tool in both the summary and abstract."},
{"id":"231","prop_id":"53","reviewer":"samadams.tesol@gmail.com","event":"Technology Fairs","review":"4","comments":"The title refers to \"brain\" but I believe the author intended to refer to \"mind.\" Overall, the repetition between the summary and abstract was not helpful in explaining the scope of this presentation. This seems like it could be useful for attendees, but I would need to better understand how \"attendees will learn how these applications can benefit students.\" Is this through a demonstration of the three tools? Practical activities? Compare\/contrast? "},
{"id":"232","prop_id":"64","reviewer":"samadams.tesol@gmail.com","event":"Technology Fairs","review":"4","comments":"There is a typo in the summary: \"outside or class\". The author should keep in mind that Technology Fairs are two back-to-back sessions of 25 minutes in length. The proposal states that it will take 35 minutes to go over all sections of the presentation. This is an important time consideration and should probably be adjusted."},
{"id":"233","prop_id":"58","reviewer":"samadams.tesol@gmail.com","event":"Technology Fairs","review":"6","comments":"The author included specific descriptions about the technology used, sequencing of the presentation, and scope of information.

{"id":"234","prop_id":"63","reviewer":"samadams.tesol@gmail.com","event":"Technology Fairs","review":"6","comments":"The author provided a clear explanation of the scope and rationale of this presentation."},
{"id":"235","prop_id":"52","reviewer":"samadams.tesol@gmail.com","event":"Technology Fairs","review":"2","comments":"Firstly, the scope of this tool use was not explained precisely. Is this usage of the tool to have become peer mentors or teachers? Similarly, this proposal is not clear in what participants will learn from this session. \"Attendees will explore the benefits..\" does not tell me how the presenter will format their presentation. This is more a review of Edpuzzle and the technique of student-led teaching than a proposal description about a presentation. There are also numerous grammatical mistakes which distract from the content of the proposal."},

Which OER's? I don't think that a case can be made for utility of OER's all-inclusively. In other words just because something is an OER does not mean it will automatically be as effective as a traditional textbook (again, depends on the textbook, and in what context). As I write this critique I think the premise is too flawed for a conference presentation."},

Perhaps the writer is talking about texts in literature. ESL or EFL is not mentioned, so not sure what kind of students the presenter has in mind.

If the purpose of the presentation is not to sell these kits, then this could be a legitimate addition to the ed tech fair.

There are 4 distinct proposals here, any of which would be perfect for a tech fair session. Google Cardboard, EdPuzzle, and Voicethread will be hard to combine in a way that will do justice to any one. Movie Maker is no longer available except in dubious versions from unauthorized sites. That said, it would be fine if the presenters want to spread these items out on a table and attempt to show them to anyone who stops by. It's going to be a three ring circus though."},
{"id":"494","prop_id":"181","reviewer":"vancestev@gmail.com","event":"Technology Fairs","review":"4","comments":"It doesn't seem that the presenters understand what goes on in tech fair presentations. They are proposing to give a talk, which they could do at the tech fair. They say they will demonstrate sample activities, and that might appeal to their audience. I'm tending to accept, but with the reservation that the presenters might not be properly visualizing the venue."},
{"id":"495","prop_id":"182","reviewer":"vancestev@gmail.com","event":"Technology Fairs","review":"2","comments":"According to my knowledge of Ning, it is not a free program. It used to be, but only for two years, https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ning_(website). At the official website you can try it for free, http:\/\/www.ning.com\/, but a free 14-day trial will not enable participants to promote \"professional social communities and to create their own social networks\" unless after 14 days they are willing to pay $25 a month, and then be limited to 1000 participants, which means that when that number is reached the administrator cannot grow the community without pruning it. The only remedy for either action, pruning or capping, is to pay double, $50 a month, to allow up to 10,000 members, which should be enough, if the administrator by then hasn't HAD enough. This presentation belongs in the exhibition area, not in the tech fair. "},
